# React Basics

## **Components:**

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They encapsulate reusable pieces of UI and logic⁠⁠.

- JSX(JavaScript XML) Syntax

  JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. For example:

  ```jsx
  // JSX
  JavaScriptCopyconst element = (
    <div className="greeting">
      <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
    </div>
  );
  ```

  JSX serves as a syntax extension to JavaScript, facilitating the combination of HTML structures with JavaScript code within React files.

  - Explain JSX

    JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React for describing what the UI should look like.

    JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that resembles HTML. It is used in React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX makes the code more readable and easier to write by allowing developers to use HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript. Under the hood, JSX is transformed into regular JavaScript function calls (e.g., React.createElement) that construct React elements. This enables the declarative style of programming in React, where the UI is described as a function of the application's state.

  - How can a browser read JSX file?

    If you want the browser to read JSX, then that JSX file should be replaced using a JSX transformer like Babel and then send back to the browser.

  - Does React use HTML?

    No, It uses JSX, which is similar to HTML.

- Functional Components

    These are modern, simpler components written as JavaScript functions. They're the preferred way to write components today. Example:

    ```jsx
      //JSX
      JavaScriptCopyconst Welcome = ({ name }) => {
        return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
      };
    ```

    Function components are the simplest way to create a component in React. They are pure JavaScript functions that take a props object as the first parameter and return React elements to display the output.

    **Example of a function component**

    ```jsx
      // JSX
      function Welcome({ personName }) {
        return <h1>{`Welcome, ${personName}!`}</h1>;
      }
    ```

    In this function component, `Welcome` takes a `personName` prop and displays a personalized welcome message.

- Class Components

    These are traditional React components written as ES6 classes. While still supported, they're less commonly used in modern React. Example:

    ```jsx
      // JSX
      JavaScriptCopyclass Welcome extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
        }
      }
    ```
  
    ****

    While class components were the standard for years, the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8 has made functional components the preferred choice for most use cases. They're more concise, easier to test, and reduce the complexity of state management through hooks.

    Alternatively, you can use ES6 classes to define a component. The equivalent class component for the above function component would look like this:

    ```jsx
    // JSX
    class Greeting extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <h1>{`Greetings, ${this.props.userName}!`} </h1>;
      }
    }
    ```

    In this class component, `Greeting` extends `React.Component` and uses a `render` method to display a greeting. The prop is accessed using `this.props.userName`

    Both function and class components accomplish the same goal of creating reusable and modular pieces of Ul. The choice between them depends on the complexity of the component and whether state or lifecycle methods are needed.

  ### **Different phases of the Class component lifecycle:**

    **Phases of the Component Lifecycle in React**

    The lifecycle of a React component is divided into four phases:

    1. **Initialization:** In this phase, the React component gets ready by setting up default props and initializing the state.
    2. **Mounting:** Mounting involves putting the elements into the browser DOM. React utilizes VirtualDOM, and during mounting, only the changed elements are updated in the browser DOM. This phase includes the following lifecycle methods:
        1. `componentWillMount`
        2. `componentDidMount`
    3. **Updating:**  When there is a change in the state or props of a component, the updating phase is triggered. This phase includes the following lifecycle methods:
        1. componentWillUpdate
        2. shouldComponentUpdate
        3. render
        4. componentDidUpdate
    4. **Unmounting:** In the unmounting phase, the component is removed from the DOM or unmounted. This phase includes the following lifecycle method:
        1. `componentWillUnmount`

  ### **Lifecycle methods of React:**

    React lifecycle methods are functions automatically called at different phases in a component's lifecycle, offering control over its behavior. Understanding and utilizing these methods empower developers to efficiently manage various aspects throughout the component's existence.

    **Example Scenario**

    Consider a YouTube application. When a user switches to another app after playing a video, efficient resource management is crucial. Lifecycle methods help developers ensure optimal utilization of resources like network and battery.

    **Key Lifecycle Methods**

    1. **constructor(**)
        1. Called during component initiation.
        2. Sets up initial state and values.
    2. **getDerivedStateFromProps()**
        1. Called just before rendering elements in the DOM.
        2. Sets up the state based on initial props.
        3. First method called on component update.
    3. **render()**
        1. Outputs or re-renders HTML to the DOM with new changes.
        2. Essential method called on every render.
    4. **componentDidMount**(**)**
        1. Called after component rendering.
        2. Executes statements requiring the component to be in the DOM.
    5. **shouldComponentUpdate()**
        1. Returns a Boolean specifying whether React should proceed with rendering.
        2. Default value is `true`.
    6. **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()**
        1. Provides access to props and state before the update.
        2. Allows checking previous values after the update.
    7. **componentDidUpdate()**
        1. Called after the component is updated in the DOM.
    8. **componentWillUnmount()**
        1. Called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.
